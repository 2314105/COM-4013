How much damage depends on the character type. Add another 'if-else' statement inside this block (this is a nested 'if' statement as discussed in the lecture). If the character is a warrior their health is reduced by 20, but (else) a scout will only have their health reduced by 10 as they dodge away from the fire quickly. Use appropriate messages to describe these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optional: Actually, other reasonable answers to the riddle are \"a bus\", \"a train\" etc. Extend your 'if-else' statement to include elif statements (in a similar way to the Decades exercise above) so there are three alternatives: the \"correct\" answer (a cold), these alternative answers (a bus, a train), and the wrong answer. When the user types an alternative answer, the booming voice should say something sulky (\"There are no such machines in this world...\") but let the character pass unharmed anyway.\n"
