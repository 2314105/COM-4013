Reaching stage 2 suggests you are on target for a top-class mark for the module. Going beyond stage 2 sets you apart as an expert. Set your goals sensibly - do not just aim for the minimum or you may struggle to pass the module."

So, it rounds the result 0.5 down to 0. The computer does this before it sees that the result is being put into a float (remember computers are stupid). \n",
